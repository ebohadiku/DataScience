### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python



```python
(3*4)+5
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

```




    17




```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
x= 200
hours = 60
mintohours = x/hours
"200 minutes is ", mintohours )
```




    ('200 minutes is ', 3.3333333333333335, 'hours')
